# Final_Project
## First of all, I am Truong Pham Tuan Nguyen and my student ID is 20020026. 
## This is my Final Project for Introduction to Computer Science.
In order to run the **index.py**, you would need to firstly install the **Data.csv** file attached in the link bellow.
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b1GVRuRBqPBi34I7hTunCIQ04SYqwNEX?usp=sharing
After installing the .csv file, please put it into the same folder as **index.py**.  


## INPUT DATA: 
So basically, the _INPUT DATA_ that I choose is the **Data.csv** in the link above. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
In this project, the Data is going to feedback from customers about hotels in several places. This project would help owners ,or researchers ,or customers to simplify the data and search for perfect hotels. Moreover, the project would figure out what is the best choices and what is the worst choices. 

## QUESTIONS:

#### Question 1:
Print out the general information of the _Data.csv_ file
#### Question 2:
Print out the first 10 rows of hotels'address and its average point.
#### Question 3:
Add a column call "Rec". If "No Negative Review" then the hotel is not going to be Reccommended. <br>
For example: <br>
s Gravesandestraat 55 Oost 1092 AA Amsterdam Netherlands(Ireland) -> _False_ <br>
Then, print the last 5 rows.
#### Question 4:
Print out number of hotels based on which country it is located at. <br>
For example: <br>
- United Kingdom: 2 <br>
- Spain: 1 <br>
- Austria: 3 
#### Question 5:
List out all hotels' address of a places which is typed in. <br>
For example: <br>
In: Austria <br>

- ... 
#### Question 6:
Print out the hotels that have highest, lowest average point. <br>
If there are many hotels which have the same score, print them all.
#### Question 7:
After that, type in an average score n (5.2 <= n <= 9.8). <br>
Print out all hotels which have that average score.
#### Question 8:
List hotels' name by average score then sort it and print it out again.
#### Question 9:
Write the new list into a new .csv file called _HotelsPointbySteven_
#### Question 10:
According to several users, they think that the _Data.csv_ file is too large. Split it into two seperated .csv file called _Data1.csv_ and _Data2.csv_
